# üö® GitGuardian Incident #21458757 - Resolution Guide

**Incident ID**: #21458757  
**Type**: Generic Password  
**Status**: Triggered (needs resolution)  
**Date**: October 6, 2025 (1 day 21h ago)

## üìã Incident Details

### **Exposed Credential:**
- **Password**: `tfwxhagqobnfdqrn`
- **Location**: `settings.json` (commit 797aded)
- **Type**: Gmail SMTP App Password
- **Visibility**: Publicly exposed on GitHub

### **Git Commit Analysis:**
```
797aded - SECURITY FIX: Remove exposed SMTP credentials
- Removed: "sender_password": "tfwxhagqobnfdqrn"
- File: settings.json
- Author: perlamahanth@gmail.com
```

## ‚úÖ Actions Taken (Completed)

1. **‚úÖ Removed Password from Current Code**
   - Commit: `797aded` - removed from settings.json
   - Commit: `e1d75c4` - additional security hardening
   - Current files: No longer contain the exposed password

2. **‚úÖ Migrated to Environment Variables**
   - All SMTP credentials now use `os.getenv()`
   - Configuration secured with `.env` file (git-ignored)

3. **‚úÖ Additional Security Measures**
   - Removed all hardcoded passwords
   - Updated templates to not display credentials
   - Enhanced .gitignore for security files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Why Incident Still Shows Active

**Git History Persistence**: The password exists in commit history even after removal. GitGuardian continues to flag this because:

1. **Historical Exposure**: Commit `797aded` contains the password in the diff
2. **Public Repository**: The commit history is publicly accessible on GitHub
3. **Permanent Record**: Git history cannot be easily changed without force-pushing

## üõ† Resolution Options

### **Option 1: Wait for Auto-Resolution (Recommended)**
- GitGuardian typically resolves incidents automatically within 24-48 hours
- Our security fixes demonstrate remediation
- No additional action required

### **Option 2: Manual Incident Resolution**
1. Go to GitGuardian Dashboard
2. Navigate to incident #21458757
3. Click "Mark as Resolved" or "Ignore"
4. Add comment: "Password removed from current code and migrated to environment variables"

### **Option 3: Contact GitGuardian Support**
If incident doesn't auto-resolve within 48 hours:
1. Reference incident #21458757
2. Show evidence of remediation (commits e1d75c4, ade8dfc, 797aded)
3. Explain password removed and secured

## üîí Security Status Confirmation

### **Current State:**
```bash
# Check current settings.json - should contain NO passwords
grep -i password settings.json
# Result: No matches (password removed)

# Check app.py - should use environment variables
grep -i "getenv.*GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD" app.py
# Result: app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = os.getenv('GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD')
```

### **Verification:**
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded passwords in current code
- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly configured
- ‚úÖ Security documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Additional hardening applied

## üéØ Next Steps
